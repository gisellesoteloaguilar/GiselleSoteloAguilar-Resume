        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Giselle Sotelo-Aguilar. Currently, I am an undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside majoring in Pre-Business. During the end of my Sophomore Year I plan to apply to the School of Business Administration and I intend to concentrate in Management. With great pride I am the first generation in my family to attend college and by doing so I hope to inspire my siblings to follow my footsteps. I grew up on the outside of Los Angeles County in a little city known as Norwalk. Many of the people that live in Norwalk barely graduate from highschool and attend college. Not only being a first generation college student greatly inspires me to excelle at school, but also being one of the few students in my city that attended a UC university. After graduating from the University of California Riverside I aspire to become a very successful restaurant owner with multiple locations opened around California. I know that with the help of my family, especially my parents, I will be able to complete my goal.<br><br>

        During my senior year at Norwalk Highschool I was involved in multiple clubs on campus. Being involved greatly benefited me because I was able to improve in organization, communication, and teamwork skills. In one of the many clubs that I was involved in I have the great pleasure to be president of the Health Occupation Student of America, also known as HOSA. In HOSA I was required to travel to Sacramento to compete in order to have the funds to travel to Sacramento the cabinet and I had to come up with creative ways to fundraise. HOSA has taught me many skills that I have incorporated in my college career. For example, the communication skills that I learned to build on in HOSA greatly aided my in being able to present in a large crowd of people.<br><br>

       Not only has HOSA helped me improve my communication, teamwork, and organization skills, but also being part of the Bio-medical club has provided me with extremely beneficial skills. When I was part of the Bio-medical club at my local highschool I was able to make friends that had the same overall goals as me, which was to be able to attend a prestigious university. By being part of the Bio-medical club I was able to make many friends that later helped me get through highschool. Additionally, I became great friends with the teachers that were in charge of the club. The teacher from the Bio-medical club that I was a part of greatly aided me when it came time to apply to multiple universities. When I needed a recommendation letter for university she was one of the few teachers that I thought of as being a great person to write me a recommendation letter. Not only did she excel in her job by making sure that tasks were completed and that everyone was doing their work, but she was also one of the few teachers at my high school that made me look forward to going to school.
